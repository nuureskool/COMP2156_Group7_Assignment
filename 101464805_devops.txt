DevOps is mainly about automation and teamwork. Instead of developers and IT operations working separately, DevOps brings them together so things can move faster and smoother.

In this course, we see how tools like Git, CI/CD pipelines, and YAML files help automate testing and deployments. This reduces mistakes and makes the whole process more organized and efficient.

Personally, I think DevOps makes system administration more efficient because everything becomes trackable and organized using version control.
