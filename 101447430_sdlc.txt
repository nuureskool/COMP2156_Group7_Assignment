The software development life cycle (SDLC) is the process that teams follow when building software.

Throughout the course, students learn the core ideas behind DevOps such as automation, continuous intergration,
and continuous deployment. Tools like Git are used to manage code changes and teamwork, while CI/CD pipelines help automate testing and deployment.
