The curriculum focuses on building skills in the following areas:

 - Tools: Ansible, Git, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

 - Architecture: Monolithic vs. Microservices and Cloud computing.

 - Automation: Using JSON, YAML, and YANG for network automation.

So far, I have found the COMP2156 DevOps course to be very interesting and engaging. The topics are presented in a clear way, which has made the course easy to follow. I enjoy learning about version control, automation, and system management. Overall, the course has been a positive learning experience for me.
