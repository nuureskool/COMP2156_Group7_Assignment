## Course Information
- **Course Code:** COMP2156
- **Course Name:** DevOps
- **Institution:** George Brown College

## Assignment Description
This repository is created as part of the COMP2156 DevOps group assignment.  
The objective of this project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of Git, GitHub collaboration, branching strategies, pull requests, and CI integration.

Each group member works on their own branch, creates required files, makes multiple commits from a local machine, and merges changes into the main branch using pull requests.

## Repository Structure
Each group member creates the following three files in their own branch:

- `StudentID_gb.txt` – Information about George Brown College  
- `StudentID_devops.txt` – Information about COMP2156 DevOps course  
- `StudentID_sdlc.txt` – Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle  

All files are merged into the `main` branch after review.

## Git Workflow
- One repository owner manages merges
- Each member works on a separate branch named: StudentID-Name
- All commits are made locally (no direct GitHub edits)
- Pull Requests are used for merging into `main`
- Merge conflicts are resolved by the repository owner

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Git
- GitHub
- GitHub Pull Requests
- GitHub Actions (CI)

## Continuous Integration
This repository uses GitHub Actions (or another free CI tool) to demonstrate basic CI integration as required by the assignment.

## Submission Notes

- Commit history is used to verify individual contributions
- Screenshots of commits, branches, and CI are included in the final submission
