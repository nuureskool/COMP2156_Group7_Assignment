The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes planning, designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. Each stage is important to ensure high-quality and reliable systems.


DevOps improves the SDLC by encouraging collaboration between developers and operations teams. Automation tools help speed up testing and deployment. This reduces delays and improves system stability. It also gives developers an opportunity to easily and seamlessly store and supplement their projects.


Git plays an important role in the software development life cycle by helping teams manage and track code changes. Using version control and branching, developers can work on features without affecting the main project, which improves collaboration and reduces errors. Git also supports code reviews through pull requests, helping improve quality and communication within teams. If issues occur, previous versions can easily be restored. In addition, Git works well with automation tools for testing and deployment. By using Git throughout the SDLC, teams can maintain organized workflows and deliver reliable software more efficiently.
